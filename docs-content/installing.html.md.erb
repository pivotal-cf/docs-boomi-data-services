atoms, inside of the context of a sub-account.

The **Username** text field allows you to enter the Dell Boomi Platform username of a service account to use for this
deployment.  Dell Boomi recommends utilizing a service account, as opposed to a named account, for audit purposes.
This field is **required**.

The **Password** fields allows you to specify the password for the Dell Boomi Platform service account.
This field is **required**.

The **Master Account ID** text field allows you to supply the Account ID of your primary Dell Boomi Platform account.
You can find this information in the Dell Boomi AtomSphere web interface, under the account menu in the top
navigation bar.

If you do not want to expose a sub-account, or set of sub-accounts, via the service broker, you can explicitly skip
them by adding their names to the **Skipped Sub-Account List**.

The **Environment Name** text field allows you to provide the name of the Primary Environment.

The **Atom Prefix** text field allows you to specify a prefix for naming the atom deployed
for the primary environment.  This prefix allows you to differentiate different installations
from one another, in Atom Management in the AtomSphere web interface.

The **Cloud Name** text field allows you to specify the name of the Atom Cloud to associate
the deployed Atom instance to.  This Cloud must have already been created in AtomSphere.
