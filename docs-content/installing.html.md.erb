This topic describes how to install and configure Boomi Data Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id="reqs-account"></a> Requirements: A Boomi AtomSphere Platform Account

You need a Boomi AtomSphere Platform account with the following:

+ At least one sub-account
+ Appropriate Boomi licenses (contact Boomi Representitive).
+ The ability to publish Integration Packs from the main account to these sub-accounts

##<a id="reqs-cloud"></a> Requirements: An Atom Cloud

Before you can configure Boomi Data Services for PCF, you need to create a
Cloud using the Boomi AtomSphere web interface.  To do so:

1. Navigate to the **Manage** &raquo;
**Cloud Management** interface:

    <img src="img/boomi-cloud-management.png">

2. Click the **+** icon in the left-hand sidebar to display a form for creating your
new AtomSphere Cloud:

    <img src="img/boomi-create-atom-cloud.png">

3. Ensure that:
    - **Allow Deployments** checkbox is checked.
    - **Max. Atom Attachments per Account** is set to **-1**.
    - **Classification** is set to **Production**.

4. Record the Cloud Name that you chose for your new cloud, because tile configuration
requires that piece of information.

5. Repeat this process for every additional (auxiliary) Atom or Molecule
environment that you want to configure and deploy.
