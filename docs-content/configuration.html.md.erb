title: Configuring Boomi Data Services for PCF (PKS) on PKS
owner: Partners

This topic describes further configuration options for Boomi Data Services for Pivotal Cloud
Foundry (PCF).

## Catalog Refresh Interval

### Tile settings -> Account Setup -> Catalog Refresh Interval

How often (in minutes) to poll the Boomi AtomSphere API looking for new
integration packs to be made available, and subsequently refresh the
catalog of available services.

This can be decresed if a faster refresh for services is required,
or this value can be increased to prevent an environment from rate limiting the
associated boomi account.

## Support for AutoFS/automounts

### Tile settings -> Advanced -> Data Volume AutoFS Configuration

This gives operators the option to specify their own custom AutoFS configuration.

Enter any AutoFS compliant automounter map in the text box here.
A commented-out configuration with fake example values has been provided (should that be useful).

If you have data volumes that you need your Boomi Data Services
installation to be able to access, as part of the process and
web service workflows you are deploying to it, you can set those
up via this configuration value.

This specifies the complete, direct map of Linux automounter
configuration, to be used on the `molecule` pods.

Here is an example, that mounts two volumes into `/data/...`:

    ```
      storage:
        autofs: |
          /data/etl3  -fstype=nfs,ro    10.7.8.9:/nas/_filer1/etl3
          /data/ftw   -fstype=nfs       172.16.31.99:/s/ee/whse1/ftw-prod
    ```

Any Boomi processes or workflows deployed to an installation
with that configuration will be able to seamlessly and
transparently access the `/data/etl3` and `/data/ftw` volumes,
remotely, and on-demand.  More importantly, failure of the
backing storage systems will not prevent the Boomi Data Services
installation from booting and performing any _other_ work.

For more details on the format of this key, see the Linux manual
page for autofs, `autofs(5)`.

## Configure the Registration/De-registration Errands (Register/De-register broker to/from PCF)

### Tile settings -> Errands -> Post-Deploy/Pre-Delete Errands

These are errands that can save you pre and post-deploy configuration.

By default, the tile will register your Boomi Data Services
Broker with your Pivotal Cloud Foundry installation, set up some
routes for accessing the broker and deployed services, and
integrate Boomi Data Services into your services marketplace.

To do this, the tile uses bespoke errand jobs called `Service Broker Registration Errand`
and `Service Broker De-registration Errand`.
These are activated by default, but can be found under the `Errands` heading in the tile.

If the registration or de-registration errand is preventing an apply-changes
from completing, they can be turned off and later implemented by hand using the
`cf create-service-broker` command or the `cf delete-service-broker` command.
More info can be found at https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html

## Scaling Deployed Resources

### Tile settings -> Resource Config

This pane contains sane defaults for the job nodes configured and deployed with this tile.
In general, you should not need to change these.
However, in the case of scaling issues, these can be reviewed and adjusted.
